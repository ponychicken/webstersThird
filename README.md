### A better dictionary for your mac

In the a blog post named [_You’re probably using the wrong dictionary_]
(http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary), James Somers proposes using Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary as it provides more evocative and accurate definitions than most modern dictionaries.

The text of the 1913 version has been digitized and [can be found on Project Gutenberg](ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext96/). Unfortunately the text files are in a very arcane format. Being created before UTF-8 was commonly used, it specifies a lot of non-standard entities to encode the all the various accents and special symbols.

This project parses these original text files and creates a reasonably clean UTF-8 XML version which can be converted into a mac dictionary file with Apple’s Dictionary Kit.

#### How to build

With NodeJS installed, run 
````
npm install
node index.js
````
Building the dictionary might take a while (around three minutes on my machine)


#### Just want the .dictionary file?
